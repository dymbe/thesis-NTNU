\citeauthor{glrecsys} argues that \acrshort{gl} can be used as a fully decentralized alternative to \acrshort{fl} \cite{glrecsys}. To prove this \citeauthor{glrecsys}, set up an experiement where they compared the performance of \acrshort{gl} to \acrshort{fl}. They concluded that \acrshort{fl} does not seem to have a clear performance advantage, \acrshort{gl} might even have an advantage in certain scenarios.

The performance was only tested on the \todo{Link to dataset or something} Movielens-dataset. The algorithms should be tested on more than one dataset to further support the conclusion.

\section{Experiments on Movielens-dataset}

The first step is to recreate the experiment performed by \citeauthor{glrecsys}.
